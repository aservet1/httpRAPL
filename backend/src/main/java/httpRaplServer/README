Super simple Java web server. It handles GET requests and directs you to the file in your directory for it. Very simple. Haven't figured out
how to get it to ask for energy samples instead of display a page. I suppose I could write an energy sample to a file and then have that
be displayed as the web page of 'the most recent energy sample'. Gotta recalibrate it quite a bit though if I'm gonna go down that route.
I think it's worth it to try and get it to work like that
