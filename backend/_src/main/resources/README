This JAR file is a snapshot of jRAPL as of 3/26/2021. This is the jRAPL interface that will be provided
for the scope of this project. No changes to my main jRAPL project will have any influence on this project,
as this is just a copy of whatever the state of jRAPL was on 3/26/2021

While it contains the Java source files, those should only serve as good-enough-for-now documentation
about what's available in this version of jRAPL. Changing them will do nothing and will only obfuscate
them as a reference.

I should not change anything in this JAR, it's just a black box that provides the jRAPL interface.
It's an external library for all intents and purposes. Black box. jRAPL provides the methods given
here, and I work with what is given. If an update really needs to happen, I can replace this JAR
with another one, but understand that this may or may not cause backwards compatibility issues,
because I don't have a formal / proper version control way of doing things with this.
