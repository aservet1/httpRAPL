# reactRAPL
Using a version of jRAPL to access CPU energy levels, then allows a user to look at them via a React app. Might allow the user to interact (RAPL powercap or DVFS) with the energy interface once I actually have that incorporated into jRAPL but right now it's just energy monitoring and stuff in terms of what it currently can already do.
