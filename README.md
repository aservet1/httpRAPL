# reactRAPL
Repo for Alejandro and Rutvik to collaborate on the jRAPL project (version 2.0)

The files for reactRAPL are based off of the jRAPL files in the master branch of https://github.com/aservet1/jRAPL as of December 13th 2020 17:00 EST

This is a totally clean copy in the sense that reactRAPL and jRAPL are now completely separate entities. No links
between each other. While they started with the same files, there is no future association between these files.
Any creations / update / deletions or literally any other operation on one file in reactRAPL will have zero impact
on any of the files in jRAPL, and vice versa.

So prety much i copied jRAPL's files to star tthis project, but these are distinct projects now. Totally different
branches of the originally same project. I started this project off by deleting a whole bunch of the previously jRAPL
files because they were totally irrelevant to the scope of this project and it's very likely I'll fundamentally change
a lot of the files that are left as I go forward with this project. There's probably going to be stuff left in common
between the projects but my main point is that I'm not guaranteeing any future association between these projects and
any similarity between these files will just be happen stance, and not tied to a special link between the reactRAPL and
jRAPL files changes to one would ever affect the other.


https://github.com/aservet1/jRAPL README for general information about jRAPL, although some implementation details will
likely differ for this version.
