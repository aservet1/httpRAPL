create a react app and move jRAPL into a folder for the back end in the react app

make a java driver right outside of jRAPL to see if you can access all relevant jRAPL objects and methods and whatever.
the goal of this is to make sure that jRAPL access is all in its nice litte module that your Java back-end web server
can manage




distant future idea, but maybe just port the C RAPL library to a goRAPL type of thing and use Go as the web server language that
accesses the Java methods?

can you just call Java from Go or is that gonna be too bloated to be worth it, i.e. goRAPL directly accessing from go / not
though Java layer would be less bloated if the name of the game was go's efficiency. IDK though, might just want to make this
a Java server. For now at least. Consider porting to Go if you really think that would be useful down the line, like if you
want to make this a Go web server instead of Java.
